As an Activator, I thrive on helping people with big dreams find ways to make them a reality. As a Communicator, I listen to the conversation, ask thought-provoking questions, and give you feedback to provide clarity, challenge, and vision.

My background is in nursing and health care management. I became a nurse to help people but quickly discovered truly helping people required a team that worked well together.  Using the Strengthsfinder™ I began to help companies and managers discover how to appreciate the power of individual talents, and how to use each person’s unique gifts to contribute to effective and powerful teams.  Turnover decreased, and customer satisfaction increased.

As organizations and responsibilities evolve leaders need to objectively evaluate how they can continue to play to their strengths.  This is particularly challenging within high growth organizations where leaders are continually pulled away from what makes them uniquely effective. - Manager Coaching : People join companies, but leave managers.

I am strongly in favor of personal development and growth using a coach - in fact, I hired a coach early on in my career and it drastically improved my personal and professional life. As a leader and executive, I experienced the benefits of an engaged team when we focused on Strengths building and skills development.  Having retired, I am focusing 100% of my time working with leaders, teams, students and individuals that want to experience successes in their relationships - personally and professionally. Understanding and unlocking your superpowers is a fantastic journey, one that is most powerfully taken with a certified coach in your passenger seat!  If you want assistance unlocking your superpowers and figuring out how to use them in your daily life, I would love to partner with you on your path to success. My clients often remark that they most appreciate my real world experiences in business actually putting Strengths based leadership to work and the examples I am able to share because of that experience.  I do not hesitate sharing my own lessons learned in the trenches of executive leadership, management and customer service to benefit you on your journey!",

I am the Founder and President of Life Uncommon, an Outpatient Chemical Dependency and Mental Health Facility near LAX Airport. Before opening Life Uncommon, I created and served as Executive Director of another Los Angeles-based treatment center for 3 years. My passion for helping addicts and alcoholics stay clean and sober and my own work in recovery inspired me to provide clients at Life Uncommon with something many treatment programs do not: the confidence, motivation, and follow-through to become self-sustaining, active members of society, while actively participating in their own recovery. All of our clients take the Strengths Assessment upon admit to our program so that we can offer the coaching and approach necessary to allow each client to embrace and develop their signature themes. A personal goal with Life Uncommon is to reduce recidivism in the world of treatment. Often clients are discharged from a program without any real life skills.  Many of them relapse for the sake of return to the safety net of treatment because they don\"t know how to achieve true independence and self-assurance. I seek to change that; for that reason exactly, the Clifton StrengthsFinder and Gallup Assessment have become integral parts of our program at LU. Before I worked in treatment and prior to my knowledge of Gallup, I maintained management positions in the Food and Beverage industry, particularly large-event catering companies throughout L.A. I am also a published writer, performance poet, and have received awards from the City of Los Angeles for volunteer work. I live with my husband and two sweet dogs and spend my free time reading and running marathons. I believe if it’s not challenging, it’s not worth it. Developing my Strengths and taking challenges head on has granted me a life in recovery beyond anything I dreamt possible for myself. I look forward to helping you discover yours.",

My experience working with an All-Star chef from The Ritz-Carlton brought this reality front and center during the early days of my leadership journey. While that year was not a waste, it was not my best either. As a leader, I found myself torn between keeping my head above water and making a real difference. I saw some leaders try to do both, but their results were at best...temporary. Others simply gave up on making a difference.With my #1 Strength being Learner, it was not surprising that neither of those options seemed good to me. I wanted to learn and master the art of leadership. But leadership that is effective, not perfunctory. Leadership that uses the best I have to offer in a way the brings true Strength to the table.That journey towards learning Strengths-based leadership has taken me through important leadership roles in two elite organizations, The Ritz-Carlton and Mid-America Transplant. And resulted with becoming a Gallup Certified Strengths Coach. As a leader, I get what leaders struggle with and know how to coach them to a place of success.

He tells anyone who will listen that, There is no greater responsibly than being a father, and there is no greater privilege than to be a Dad.In 2014, he celebrated his birthday by inviting 78 of his closest friends to dinner just to thank them for their friendship. George believes that his life has been blessed beyond measure and mentoring is a small way to give back. Having an aversion to work for anyone, he started multiple businesses. He opened a Printing company in his junior year in high school, started a vending company when he was 19 and began investing in real estate in his early twenties.  In 1985, he purchased a small computer company that built IBM clones and in 2001 he entered the world of Security where he founded and is the current President of Surveillance Solutions. While training for a half marathon, he began to evaluate where he wanted to invest the balance of his life now that his daily daddy duties were nearing an end. Where could he make the best use of 35+ years of business experience and still engage the passion he had raising his children? He remembered how the Gallup Strengths Finder Assessment had greatly helped him understand how people are motivated and inspired. What better way to invest his life than to help people to become a better version of themselves by learning and improving what’s right with them instead of what’s wrong with them? What better organization to partner with than the Gallup Company? So he went through Gallup’s comprehensive Accelerated Coaching Course and became a Gallup Certified Strengths Coach. Next, he created a company dedicated to helping people transform their lives. His forthcoming book is called StrengthFormation –Transformation through Strength. Gallup proclaims that individuals are not meant to be well rounded, Teams should. The power behind StrengthsFinders is the exponential explosion that happens when a Team aims their individual Strengths at a specific goal.

AYT believes the foundation of an integrated wellness initiative is a combination of learning about and leveraging professionals’ natural tendencies, talents, and strengths AND improving their overall physical fitness.   Our leadership development sessions are fast-paced and center around small-group discussions that allow participants to gain deep understanding of the topics discussed. We base our curriculum around the assumption that individual strengths offer the greatest room for personal and professional growth.  We designed the program (signature workouts with different exercises) to create both variety and the ability to benchmark performance. All workouts can be modified to meet the relative fitness levels of individuals. The small group atmosphere creates a supportive environment in which growth is encouraged and celebrated.",

Part of that status quo is the idea that fixing our weaknesses leads to improved performance. It does not! It leads to chasing unattainable goals, increased spending for inadequate returns on investment, and relentless changes to what are described as strategic plans and visions. Make meaningful and lasting changes in your personal career and the culture of your organization by focusing on what you and your fellow workers are already exceptional at and naturally predisposed to do. Build dynamic teams of engaged, high-performing employees who consistently exceed expectations and achieve incredible results. Let me help you start on a path to personal and professional growth. With a degree in secondary education, previous national teacher exam certification, and currently an instructor at an Army post-graduate school, I understand the challenges students and faculty face; competing demands for teacher time, large teacher-student classroom sizes, a desire for dynamic classroom environments with the latest technologies but with reduced resources and continual budget cuts... I\"ve coached students from middle school to post-graduate level and teachers and faculty from high school to college. Whether student or faculty, I can help you achieve your academic career goals, develop life plans for college and beyond, and help students and faculty alike get the most out of the academic environment. As a consultant to small businesses, I understand that there are no small setbacks. Every decision, every sale, every remake, every employee absence, every change to federal regulation is potentially the difference between profit and bankruptcy.

Companies have a real need to increase engagement and reduce the high cost of associate turnover. I feel strongly that using strengths as a means to differentiate people from what they do naturally and productively, will give a company the competitive advantage they are seeking. People who want to come to work and enjoy being there will allow your company to flourish! Knowing that almost 70% of the workforce in America are not engaged at work is a scary thought. Let me help you find the strengths you already own and aim them at something more in line with who you are. Linking your strengths to a purpose is what brings the shine out of you and helps you be all you can be. Let\"s help you learn, love and live your strengths moving forward! I have already helped over 300 people in a Faith-based process to see their service is linked to who they were created to be. Certain strengths align with roles with a church community and allow you to help build your community into something much stronger.

Sarah affirms individual strengths and encourages reflection upon theme dynamics and power and edge statements. Sarah believes that strengths coaching can help others achieve good to great, and she strives to ignite (or maybe re-ignite) individual and team passion and purpose.  Sarah believes that Strengths, when aimed effectively: positively, professionally, and personally, lead to life-long fulfillment and enhances overall well-being. And at the end of the day, personal well-being matters the most.

She is passionate about improving employee engagement levels within organizations and helping individuals live their legacy.  Her 15 years of work experience includes HR and organization development consulting, career coaching, and training delivery.  She has consulted across numerous industries and delivered training for organizations such as such as Accenture, John Deere, ACT, The University of Kansas, and The University of Northern Iowa. Follow Your Strengths offers customized StrengthsFinder® training workshops, performance management training, strengths coaching, and speaking engagements. Additionally, Traci provides employee engagement consulting leveraging Gallup’s Q12 Employee Engagement survey combined with training and coaching to improve actively organizational performance. She challenges teams to view one another through the lens of strengths to improve communication, collaboration, and overall engagement and effectiveness. Traci is a Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR) and earned her B.B.A. in Management and Organizations from The University of Iowa and her M.S. in Counseling Psychology from The University of Kansas.  A Director at one of her clients had this to say about Traci’s StrengthsFinder training programs: StrengthsFinder has changed the way we approach employee training and growth here.  Traci did a great job of facilitating a path that has become part of our daily interactions with each other.  Understanding people’s strengths and capitalizing on growing what already comes naturally to individuals is much more productive than asking people to change who they innately are.  Building your team’s projects and goals using the strengths of the individuals in the collective creates an environment where employees can succeed, productivity can increase, and everyone wins!
